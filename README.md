# comp22712-labs
My solutions to the COMP22712 labs from 2020.

## Disclaimer
Please don't copy these for your coursework, they will not work.
They only work in Komodo.

Do feel free to use `preprocess.py` if you need to compile to one `.s` file and have many.
It will correctly resolve any imports you have, I believe even nested ones though it was a while since I wrote it...

You may also use any of the sprites I created them myself with ![piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/) ~~hence why they look meh~~

## Note on the directories
- `labX/` is my solution to lab X
    - my grades for each assessed lab were 18, 19, 19 and 20 for a grade of 95%
- `lab9/` contains my snake game implementation, if you have a Komodo instance you can hopefully run this.
- `fuck_yeah/` contains the snake game with the logic changed to wrap around walls instead.

## Note on the game
- easy is too easy
- medium is fine
- hard is too hard
- extreme is ridiculous
